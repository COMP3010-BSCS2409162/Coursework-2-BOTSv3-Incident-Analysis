# Coursework 2: BOTSv3 Incident Analysis - MAL3024
This repository contains all supporting materials for my Assessment 2 submission for COMP3010 – Security Operations & Incident Response. The task involved investigating the Splunk Boss of the SOC v3 (BOTSv3) dataset, answering one full set of 200-level questions, and analysing the incident using Splunk Enterprise.

**Overview**
The BOTSv3 dataset simulates real-world attacks targeting the fictional company Frothly. Using Splunk Enterprise, I performed log analysis, correlation, and threat investigation focused on AWS CloudTrail, S3 access logs, and Windows event logs.
